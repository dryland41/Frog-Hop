Make a screen with three sections. The section in the middle represents a river and the sections on the sides represent land.

Display a group of items on one side of the river to start.  When one of these items are tapped, make it cross the river.

Include a randomized feature so that an item has the possibility of ending up in the river in the process of crossing. 

Any item in the river can no longer move. Any item on land can attempt to cross the river.

Bonus: When all items land in the river, make an Alert-dialogue box and a toast message display to the user stating that theyâ€™ve lost all their items.

I used the "How to Send Data Between 2 Fragments Using a Shared ViewModel - Android Studio Tutorial" from Coding in Flow as my starting point on this one.
